        What is this website about? This site is a combination of a few things.  It is a project I am using for to practice
        web development (php, javascript, css, mysql).  It will showcase some other projects I have done including programming
        projects and some other projects.  I am planning on building some useful tools and widgets in javascript, as well
        as collect data on traffic to the site.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have noticed several malicious attempts made on the server so far, this provides an opportunity to analyse the
        traffic and possibly build some interesting tools such as ones that automatically report abuse from offending ip addresses.
