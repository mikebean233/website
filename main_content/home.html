        <h3>What is this website about?</h3>
        This site is a combination of a few things. It is a project I am using to practice web development (php, javascript,
        css, mysql). It will showcase some other projects I have done including programming projects as well as other
        categories. I am planning on building some useful tools and widgets in JavaScript, as well as collect data on
        traffic to the site.

        I have noticed several malicious attempts made on the server so far, this provides an opportunity to analyze the
        traffic and possibly build some interesting tools such as one that automatically reports abuse from offending ip
        addresses.
